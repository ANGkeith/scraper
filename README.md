# Scraper

This repository is part of my personal project for practising usage of selenium
and docker.

This is used for scraping websites, and sending notification on telegram when
certain conditions are met.

## Prerequisites

The only dependency is docker :).

```
## Usage
To start the container(s).

``` bash
# cp .env.example .env and replace the values accordingly
make run
```
